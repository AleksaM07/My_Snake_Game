#### My snake game: 
Some of my first more involved code in python, it is done with a turtle library. using multiple turtles as a snake I made it eat other turtles and mesure the score.
I have couple of files:
-main.py
-scorebore.py contains the scoreborad class and it is for keeping and updating the score/highscore
-food.py contains the class witch defines food where and how its generated
-snake.py is a class which makes the snake and adds to its lenght
-data.txt keeps the highscore
-slika.png is just the background
